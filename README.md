# Project Title
**Highridge Construction Company Weekly Payment System**

## Overview
This project is a Python and R program built to generate payment slips for workers at Highridge Construction Company. The program dynamically creates a list of 450 workers, generates payment slips based on conditions specified in the assignment, and includes exception handling to manage potential errors.

## Features
- **Dynamic Worker List**: I generated a list of 450 workers with random salaries and gender. The task specified at least 400, so I chose to do 450.
- **Payment Slip Generation**: I used conditional logic to assign employee levels based on salary and gender and generate payment slips.
- **Exception Handling**: I created this to handle potential errors to ensure the program runs smoothly.
- **Python and R Implementations**: I built the logic in both Python and R.

## Files Included
- `HIghRidge_Python.ipynb`: This is my Python implementation of the payslips.
- `HIghRidge_R.ipynb`: This is my R implementation of the weekly payment system.
- `README.md`: This is me providing context on the project and instructions on how to use the code.

## Running the Code
- **Python**: 
  - Connect to Google Colab, start a Python runtime, and paste the code or upload the notebook to run it.
  - Or copy and paste the code into any Python environment like Jupyter Notebook.
  
- **R**:
  - Connect to Google Colab, start an R runtime, and paste the code or upload the notebook to run it.
