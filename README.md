Project Title
Highridge Construction Company Weekly Payment System

Overview
This project is a Python and R program built to generate payment slips for workers at Highridge Construction Company. The program dynamically creates a list of 450 workers, 
generates payment slips based on conditions specified in the assignment, and includes exception handling to manage potential errors.

Features
Dynamic Worker List: I generated a list of 450 workers with random salaries and gender. The task said at least 400, so I choose to do 450
Payment Slip Generation: I used conditional logic to assign employee levels based on salary and gender and generate payment slips.
Exception Handling: I created this to handle potential errors to ensure the program runs smoothly.
Python and R Implementations: I built the logic in both Python and R.

Files Included
HIghRidge Python.ipynb: The Python implementation of the payslips
HIghRidge R.ipynb: The R implementation of the weekly payment system.
README.md: This file, providing instructions on how to use the code.
